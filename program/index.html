                Understanding the relationship between the functional activity and the structural wiring of the brain is an important question in 
                neuroscience. To address this, various mathematical modeling approaches have been undertaken in the past, which largely consisted 
                of non-linear and biophysically detailed mathematical models with regionally varying model parameters. While such models provide us 
                a rich repertoire of dynamics that can be displayed by the brain, they are computationally demanding. Moreover, although neuronal 
                dynamics at the microscopic level are nonlinear and chaotic, it is unclear if such detailed nonlinear models are required to 
                capture the emergent meso- (regional population ensemble) and macro-scale (whole brain) behavior, which is largely deterministic 
                and reproducible across individuals. Indeed, recent modeling effort based on spectral graph theory has shown that a linear and 
                analytical model without regionally varying parameters can capture the empirical MEG frequency spectra and 
                the spatial patterns of the alpha and beta frequency bands accurately. In this talk, we will demonstrate spectral graph models that can 
                accurately capture functional dynamics in fMRI and MEG separately.

                The human brain, composed of billions of neurons and synaptic connections, is an 
                intricate network coordinating a sophisticated balance of excitatory and 
                inhibitory activity between brain regions. The dynamical balance between 
                excitation and inhibition is vital for adjusting neural input/output 
                relationships in cortical networks and regulating the dynamic range of their 
                responses to stimuli. To infer this balance using connectomics, we recently 
                introduced a computational framework based on the Ising model, first developed 
                to explain phase transitions in ferromagnets, and proposed a novel hybrid 
                resting-state structural connectome (rsSC). Here, we show that a generative 
                model based on the Kuramoto phase oscillator can be used to simulate static and 
                dynamic functional connectomes (FC) with rsSC as the coupling weight 
                coefficients, such that the simulated FC well aligns with the observed FC when 
                compared to that simulated with traditional structural connectome. Simulations 
                were performed using the open-source framework The Virtual Brain on High 
                Performance Computing infrastructure.

                Among the complex dynamical features that are commonly described in brain dynamics, 
                the continuously evolving correlation patterns of the brain (Functional Connectivity 
                Dynamics, FCD) has been extensively characterized and described as a marker for aging 
                and psychiatric disorders. More recently, the existence of high-order interdependencies 
                of either synergistic or redundant types has also been shown to change with aging, 
                with brain activity from older healthy subjects showing more redundancy. To understand 
                how different topological features of the structural connectome can be related to these 
                features of the functional connectivity, we performed a systematic assessment using a 
                set of 240-node structural connectomes with varying degrees of integration and 
                segregation. The set of over 40 SCs spanned a broad range of the small-world coefficient 
                omega, sweeping from lattice-like to small-world to random-like networks. The SCs were 
                used to simulate neural activity using a Wilson-Cowan model modified with homeostatic 
                inhibitory plasticity, to ensure an oscillatory regime over a wide range of the global 
                connectivity parameter G. Then, the simulated activity was assessed for the FCD, using 
                the variance of the FCD matrix as an index for dynamical richness, and for the emergence 
                of synergistic interdependencies, by randomly sampled groups of 3, 4, or 5 nodes. The 
                nature of the high-order dependencies was assessed using the O-information metric, that 
                is negative for systems dominated by synergy and positive for those with more redundancy. 
                The networks that maximized both complex dynamical features were those having a positive 
                omega index but close to zero. This indicates networks of the small-world type, which 
                have a balance between their integration and segregation metrics. Our results are in 
                agreement with what has been observed in the brain SC and its dynamics as the brain ages.

                Human brain is a system of networks, each underlying a specific function, and 
                interacting with each other. The discovery of brain networks 'at rest'; i.e., 
                resting state networks (RSNs), has been very influential in characterisation 
                of the functional organisation of the brain. The framework of Probabilistic 
                Functional Modes (PFMs), allows to estimate RSNs simultaneously for populations 
                and every individual therein, thus permitting us to capture individual-specific 
                characteristics beyond what has been possible using standard group-average-based 
                techniques such as ICA. In this talk, we will first describe the latest advances 
                in PFM modelling, including stochastic PFMs for big fMRI data. We will then 
                present a novel type of RSN representation discovered by high-dimensional PFMs 
                (150 modes), which includes both large-scale and fine-grained RSNs simultaneously. 
                We refer to this new decomposition as hybrid-RSNs. We show that hybrid-RSNs are 
                spatially and temporally correlated, and capture functional (i.e., temporal) 
                multiplicity within brain networks, whilst maintaining the distributed spatial 
                organisation of the brain function, without over-splitting it into small units. 
                We validate hybrid-RSNs based on existing individualised parcellations, and 
                further show that they are reproducible across two large datasets (HCP and UK 
                Biobank) and two fMRI data types (volumetric and surface based). We further 
                demonstrate the prediction power of these high-dimensional PFMs for 899 phenotypes 
                in UK Biobank, and show that they can predict personalised traits more accurately 
                and interpretably compared with current standard techniques. Therefore, this RSN 
                representation, which we release publicly, provides a new basis for spontaneous 
                brain activity and brain-behaviour studies.

                Neural activity bursts are cascade-like events ubiquitously observed across imaging modalities and 
                scales. A great deal of information is encoded in the aperiodic timing and topographic 
                distribution of these events. In particular, bursts are tightly related to the emergence of 
                large-scale correlations, whereby the spreading of these patterned processes underlie the 
                formation of resting state networks. Furthermore, bursting activity is the manifestation of 
                brain complexity, which makes them candidates for neuronal correlates of higher-level 
                cognition and consciousness. I will present this evidence in several case studies, including 
                the analysis of resting state network reconfiguration after focal brain lesions, the 
                assessment of consciousness levels in humans, and connectome-based simulations, among others. 
                The capability of the brain to burst might be the manifestation of a general mechanism of 
                multiscale communication underlying brain function, cognition, and behavior.

                Brain communication, defined as information transmission through white-matter 
                connections, is at the foundation of the brain's computational capacities that 
                virtually subtend all aspects of behavior: from sensory perception shared across 
                mammalian species, to complex cognitive functions in humans. How did 
                communication strategies in macroscale brain networks adapted across evolution 
                to accomplish increasingly complex functions? In this work we introduce a new 
                framework that leverages information theory principles and multimodal magnetic 
                resonance imaging data to identify structural pathways of the brain network 
                selected for information transmission, and measure the level of parallel 
                communication across different brain circuits. By applying this framework to 
                human, macaque and mouse data, we show a gap in brain network communication 
                strategies between humans and other mammals, with the first tailored toward 
                parallel communication and the latter toward selective information transmission. 
                Parallel communication strategies are specific to individual subjects and appear 
                to act as a major connector of unimodal (sensory, attentional) and transmodal 
                (fronto-parietal, default mode) areas in the human brain, possibly contributing 
                to the evolution of more complex cognitive functions in humans. Our results link 
                the complexity of macroscale brain communication dynamics inferred within a new 
                information theory framework to an evolutionary gap between mammalian lineages.

                circuits to fall into an Off-period after an initial activation. Cortical bistability is thought to disrupt the build-up of 
                sustained causal interactions typically observed in healthy wakefulness, and it has important clinical implications, being 
                associated with loss of consciousness or loss of functions. In this talk, we will provide a mechanistic explanation of these 
                findings by means of mean-field theory and simulations of a cortical-like module endowed with activity-dependent adaptation. 
                First, we will show that fundamental aspects of the local responses elicited in humans by direct cortical stimulation can be 
                replicated by systematically varying the relationships between adaptation strength and excitation level in the network. Then, 
                we will reveal a region in the adaptation-excitation parameter space of key relevance for both physiological and pathological 
                conditions, where spontaneous activity and responses to perturbation diverge in their ability to reveal Off-periods. Finally, 
                we will substantiate through simulations of connected cortical-like modules the role of adaptation mechanisms in preventing 
                cortical neurons from engaging in reciprocal causal interactions, as suggested by empirical studies.

                In this work, we explore the properties of a hierarchical, 
                linearized, and analytic spectral graph theory-based model that can capture the frequency spectra obtained from 
                magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. The model consists of coupled excitatory and inhibitory dynamics of the 
                neural ensembles for every brain region, and white-matter structural wiring-based long-range excitatory macroscopic dynamics.  
                We demonstrate that this model, with just a parsimonious set of global and biophysically interpretable model parameters, 
                can display frequency-rich spectra. In particular, we show that even without any oscillations on the regional level, 
                the macroscopic model alone can exhibit oscillations with a frequency in the alpha band. We also show that depending on 
                the parameters, the model can exhibit damped oscillations, limit cycles, or unstable oscillations that blow up with time. 
                We further determined bounds on these parameters to ensure stability of the modeled oscillations. 
                Lastly, we outline a strategy to capture dynamics of MEG in terms of dynamics of these model parameters.
                These biophysically interpretable model parameters can be employed to investigate correlates of differences in 
                frequency spectra observed in different brain states and neurological diseases.
