                A rich repertoire of oscillatory signals is detected from human brains with electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). 
                However, the principles underwriting coherent oscillations and their link with the underlying structural connectome remain 
                under debate. I will present a mechanistic hypothesis where transient brain rhythms are a signature of metastable synchronization, 
                occurring at reduced collective frequencies due to delays between brain areas. We consider a system of damped oscillators in the 
                presence of background noise – approximating the short-lived gamma-frequency oscillations generated within neuronal circuits – 
                coupled according to the diffusion weighted tractography between brain areas. Varying the global coupling strength and conduction 
                speed, we identify a critical regime where spatially and spectrally resolved metastable oscillatory modes (MOMs) emerge at 
                sub-gamma frequencies, approximating the MEG power spectra from healthy individuals at rest. Further, we demonstrate that the 
                frequency, duration, and scale of MOMs – as well as the frequency-specific envelope functional connectivity – can be controlled 
                by global parameters, while the connectome structure remains unchanged. Grounded in the physics of delay-coupled oscillators, 
                these numerical analyses demonstrate how interactions between locally generated fast oscillations in the connectome spacetime 
                structure can lead to the emergence of collective brain rhythms organized in space and time.

                Understanding the relationship between the functional activity and the structural wiring of the brain is an important question in 
                neuroscience. To address this, various mathematical modeling approaches have been undertaken in the past, which largely consisted 
                of non-linear and biophysically detailed mathematical models with regionally varying model parameters. While such models provide us 
                a rich repertoire of dynamics that can be displayed by the brain, they are computationally demanding. Moreover, although neuronal 
                dynamics at the microscopic level are nonlinear and chaotic, it is unclear if such detailed nonlinear models are required to 
                capture the emergent meso- (regional population ensemble) and macro-scale (whole brain) behavior, which is largely deterministic 
                and reproducible across individuals. Indeed, recent modeling effort based on spectral graph theory has shown that a linear and 
                analytical model without regionally varying parameters can capture the empirical MEG frequency spectra and 
                the spatial patterns of the alpha and beta frequency bands accurately. In this talk, we will demonstrate spectral graph models that can 
                accurately capture functional dynamics in fMRI and MEG separately.

                Decades of neurobiological research have disclosed the diverse manners in which the response properties of neurons are 
                dynamically modulated to support adaptive cognitive functions. This neuromodulation is achieved through alterations in 
                the biophysical properties of the neuron. However, changes in cognitive function do not arise directly from the modulation 
                of individual neurons, but are mediated by population dynamics in mesoscopic neural ensembles. Understanding this multiscale 
                mapping is an important but nontrivial issue. Here, we bridge these different levels of description by showing how 
                computational models parametrically map classic neuromodulatory processes onto systems-level models of neural activity. 
                The ensuing critical balance of systems-level activity supports perception and action, although our knowledge of this 
                mapping remains incomplete. In this way, quantitative models that link microscale neuronal neuromodulation to systems-level 
                brain function highlight gaps in knowledge and suggest new directions for integrating theoretical and experimental work.

                Neuroimaging recordings of mammalians’ brains reveal the dynamic formation of distributed resting-state networks. 
                Typical activation patterns are captured by Functional Connectivity (FC) measures. However, brain networks are constantly 
                re-configuring and FC is dominated by few salient events. These events can be associated with short lived bursts of 
                co-activations, where multiple regions across the brain collectively deviate from baseline activity. The origin and the 
                relevance of these bursts is still debated. First, using whole-brain modeling we simulate dynamic FC patterns and we show 
                that spontaneous bursts of co-activations naturally emerge. In the simulations, the bursts originate from localized neuronal 
                fluctuations that propagate through the connectome recruiting down-stream regions in a cascade effect. Then, we study the 
                effects of single region shut-down on the whole-brain network dynamics. We analyze a computational model as well as two 
                empiric datasets where resting state hemodynamic activity was recorded in mice before and after the shut-down of either 
                cortical hubs (via chemogenetic inhibition) or thalamic nuclei (via lesion). In all cases, we show a consistent decrease 
                of spatial correlations' strength, and the proportional loss of bursty network dynamics. Finally, we discuss the multi-scale 
                mechanisms of network response to localized perturbations, which understanding is fundamental for developing predictive brain models.

                Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) represent two ends of a neurodegenerative continuum. 
                Mutations in C9orf72 gene is a leading, shared genetic factor that can result in familial FTD, ALS, and/or ALS-FTD.  
                Thus, there exists an opportunity for preventative interventions prior to disease onset in individuals with known genetic 
                mutations.  However, pre-symptomatic biomarkers to monitor disease progression in C9orf72 mutation carriers are currently 
                lacking. Prior neuroimaging studies suggest that disruptions of functional and structural connectomes are an early feature of 
                neurodegeneration. In this work, we perform a multi-modal, cross-sectional study of brain connectomes derived from diffusion 
                and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for a cohort of C9orf72 mutation carriers (pre-symptomatic and symptomatic) and 
                controls from the Human Connectome Project-FTD (HCP-FTD) study. Our results show significant but divergent disruptions in modularity 
                in structural and functional connectomes for C9orf72 mutation carriers with respect to controls, with the pre-symptomatic subjects 
                showing an intermediate effect between controls and symptomatic subjects for both modalities. The divergence in structural and 
                functional connectomes is corroborated by a graph Fourier transform based analysis of structure-function coupling, where we observe 
                significant structure-function decoupling in anatomically plausible brain regions for C9orf72 mutation carriers. Finally, we also 
                observe significant associations between network metrics and plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) for C9orf72 mutation carriers. 
                Therefore, changes in modularity and structure-function coupling may be a plausible feature of C9orf72 neurodegeneration.

                Brain function relies on a precisely coordinated and dynamic balance between the functional integration and segregation of 
                distinct networks. Characterizing the way in which brain regions reconfigure their interactions to give rise to distinct 
                but hidden brain states remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose a Bayesian method for characterizing community 
                structure-based latent brain states and showcase a novel strategy based on posterior predictive discrepancy using the latent 
                block model to detect transitions between community structures in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series. The set of 
                estimated parameters in the model includes a latent label vector that assigns network nodes to communities, and also block model 
                parameters that reflect the weighted connectivity within and between communities. Besides extensive in-silico model evaluation, 
                we also provide empirical validation (and replication) using the Human ConnectomeProject (HCP) dataset of 100 healthy adults. 
                Our results obtained through an analysis of task-fMRI data during working memory performance show appropriate lags between external 
                task demands and change-points between brain states, with distinctive community patterns distinguishing fixation, low-demand and 
                high-demand task conditions.

                First, we attempted to leverage a function-constrained structural graph variational autoencoder (VAE) that 
                incorporates information from both resting-state functional and structural connectome in an unsupervised fashion. 
                This leads to a joint low-dimensional embedding that establishes a unified spatial coordinate system. When tested on 
                OASIS-3, a large publicly available Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dataset, results showed that a variational formulation 
                may be necessary to encode temporally-varying functional brain dynamics. Further, the joint functional-structural 
                embedding approach is better at characterizing subject sub-populations than approaches that only leverage the structural 
                connectome. If time permits, I will briefly recap our statistical physics based model to infer Excitation-Inhibition balance 
                on the connectome level that was introduced in last year’s workshop and provide some updates using the OASIS-3 dataset.

                The biological mechanisms that allow the brain to balance flexibility and integration remain poorly understood. 
                A potential solution may lie in a unique aspect of neurobiology, which is that numerous brain systems contain 
                diffuse synaptic connectivity. Here, we demonstrate that increasing diffuse cortical coupling within a validated 
                biophysical corticothalamic model traverses the system through a quasi-critical regime in which spatial heterogeneities 
                in input noise support transient critical dynamics in distributed subregions. The presence of quasicritical states 
                coincides with known signatures of complex, adaptive brain network dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of 
                similar dynamic signatures in empirical whole-brain human neuroimaging data. Together, our results establish that

                Dynamic resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) characterizes fluctuations that occur over time in functional brain networks. 
                The most popular sliding-window and clustering methods for extracting dynamic RSFC have various limitations preventing them to 
                extract reliable features that associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We utilize the robust time-varying dynamic network 
                (TVDN) approach to extract the dynamic RSFC features from high resolution Magnetoencephalography data, which automatically and 
                adaptively learns the low-dimensional manifold of dynamic RSFC and detects dynamic state transitions in data. We show the number 
                of brain states, and the number of brain state transitions are strong predictors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Furthermore, 
                the features from TVDN have high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing AD and healthy subjects.

                The dynamics of most natural systems are fundamentally constrained by their underlying structure, and the nervous 
                system is no exception. Here, we determine the principles underlying how large-scale dynamics are shaped by the 
                brain's structure and anatomy. Specifically, we derive the eigenmodes of cortical surface geometry and show how 
                they can explain the patterns of task-evoked and resting-state activity at the whole-brain level. Finally, we combine 
                the eigenmodes with a simple model of wave dynamics to provide a mechanistic account for diverse empirical data and 
                physiological phenomena.

                In this work, we explore the properties of a hierarchical, 
                linearized, and analytic spectral graph theory-based model that can capture the frequency spectra obtained from 
                magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. The model consists of coupled excitatory and inhibitory dynamics of the 
                neural ensembles for every brain region, and white-matter structural wiring-based long-range excitatory macroscopic dynamics.  
                We demonstrate that this model, with just a parsimonious set of global and biophysically interpretable model parameters, 
                can display frequency-rich spectra. In particular, we show that even without any oscillations on the regional level, 
                the macroscopic model alone can exhibit oscillations with a frequency in the alpha band. We also show that depending on 
                the parameters, the model can exhibit damped oscillations, limit cycles, or unstable oscillations that blow up with time. 
                We further determined bounds on these parameters to ensure stability of the modeled oscillations. 
                Lastly, we outline a strategy to capture dynamics of MEG in terms of dynamics of these model parameters.
                These biophysically interpretable model parameters can be employed to investigate correlates of differences in 
                frequency spectra observed in different brain states and neurological diseases.

                Graph signal processing is an established method which has recently been adopted for neuroscience. 
                It fits well with the idea that the brain can be conceptualized as a network - or graph - and provides 
                mathematical tools for analyzing functional time series that evolve on top of a fixed structural connectivity. 
                A basic yet versatile idea is that a brain graph can be decomposed into building blocks, or basis functions, 
                that can then be used to understand network organization. These basis functions are also known as harmonic modes, 
                functional harmonics, or, in the case of higher-resolution data, gradients. These modes are theoretically linked 
                to the physical phenomenon of standing waves. In my talk, I will show our recent work on functional harmonics - derived 
                from resting state fMRI - that includes subcortical structures, in particular the cerebellum. I will put emphasis on 
                the role of negative correlations between fMRI-time courses, as the question of how to interpret and handle them is 
                still a matter of debate.
